    "\n",
    "Explain the concept of batch normalization in the context of Artificial Neural Networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch normalization is a technique used to improve the training stability and speed of artificial neural networks (ANNs). It normalizes the output of each layer, specifically normalizing the activations of each neuron across a mini-batch of data. The normalization process involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe the benefits of using batch normalization during training:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Training Speed: Batch normalization reduces the internal covariate shift, allowing for higher learning rates and faster convergence during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: It acts as a form of regularization by adding noise to the activations, which reduces overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stabilizes Gradient: Batch normalization helps in addressing the vanishing and exploding gradient problems by normalizing the gradients, leading to more stable training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss the working principle of batch normalization, including the normalization step and the learnable parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "The working principle of batch normalization involves two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
